Integer Right Triangles
Project Euler Problem #39
by Muaz Siddiqui

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, 
there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
